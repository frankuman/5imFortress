## Project Overview
5imFortress is an ongoing IT security project developed as part of a university course at Blekinge Tekniska H√∂gskola (BTH). The project revolves around creating a realistic simulation for 5G towers in Blekinge L√§n, Sweden. These towers are controlled by a HMI ModBus Server, which allows for modifications to the hardware of the 5G towers. Additionally, the project **will** include an attack on the ModBus server, simulating a breach attempt to test the security of 5G tower systems.
